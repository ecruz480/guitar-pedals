# DIY guitar pedals

A repo for DIY guitar pedals I have custom built for different musicians. I consider these builds to be the precursor to my work with eurorack modules, but I hope to design more in the future.

**polyphonic-shift-UPSHAL**  
Polyphonic pitch shift pedal based on EQDs Rainbow Machine. The pedal was designed for pop artist [UPSHAL.](https://www.upsahl.com/)

**echo-delay-mirage**  
Echo and delay combo pedal based on EQDs Ghost Echo. The pedal was designed for the shoegaze band [Cirtus Clouds](https://citrusclouds.bandcamp.com/) and named 'Mirage'.
