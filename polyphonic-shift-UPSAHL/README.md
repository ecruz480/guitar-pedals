![IMG-3141](https://github.com/ecruz480/guitar-pedals/assets/6435014/754b915f-c1d6-4d9b-ac5c-1a15ecdc051e)  
This is a polyphonic pitch shift pedal based on the Spin FV-1 digital IC. This design is a clone of Earthquake Device's Rainbow Machine pedal.

This is the first pedal I constructed, it uses a pre-made PCB from [PedalPCB]([https://www.pedalpcb.com/product/leprechaun/]).

### Features
- Runs on 9V, center-pin negative.  
- Six controls for primary, pitch, secondary, magic, tone, and tracking.
- Two stompbox switches with light-up LED rings. One is for turning the pedal on/off, the other is labeled 'Drugs' which directly controls the 'magic' parameter.
- Expression jack is omitted in this design

### Dimensions
Stompbox type: 1590BB  
Length: 4.71"  
Width: 3.70"  
Heigth: 1.18"
